        I have now been dedicating myself to my own website on Notion for some time and have had great pleasure in all its utilities.
        Figured I would pursue myself in getting to know webdevelopement better and therefore slowly and steadily transition all my work over the years from notion to this personal website.
        Let's see how much learning this will bring \smiley.
